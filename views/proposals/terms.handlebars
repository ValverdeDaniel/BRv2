    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>7. Limitations of Liability. </strong>

    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>11. Severability. </strong>

        or any other provision or right.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>13. Entire Agreement.</strong>
        This Agreement represents and constitutes the entire agreement between
        the parties, and supersede and merge all prior negotiations,
        agreements, and understandings, oral or written, with respect to any
        and all matters between the parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>14. Governing Law.</strong>

        other party its expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and
        costs) incurred in connection with the action an any appeal.
    </p>
    <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What is a Photo License Agreement?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A photo license agreement is a legal contract where the
                    owner of a photo licenses the use of the image to a person
                    or company. The original owner retains the copyright of the
                    image. The contract stipulates the terms on how, when, and
                    where the licensee can use that photograph. In the photo
                    licensing agreement, the licensor is the person who owns
                    the copyrights or is licensing rights to use the image. The
                    licensee is the person who is gaining the rights to use the
                    image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a photo license agreement, the copyright is not being
                    sold -- the licensee is essentially licensing the right to
                    use it, not own it. If you're an independent photographer,
                    the copyright for an image belongs to you as soon as you
                    take the picture. However, if a photographer is working
                    through a company in a work for hire arrangement, the
                    copyright may belong to the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In short, you need to hold the copyright in order to
                    license the work to another party.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>When Do I Need One?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Holding a copyright to a photograph doesn't produce any
                    income in itself. A photographer may charge a session fee
                    or other fees associated with a shoot. If a photographer
                    takes photos where they retain the copyright, developing a
                    photo licensing agreement to sell usage to clients becomes
                    an excellent way to earn revenue from the work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A photo license agreement protects both the copyright
                    holder and the person who wishes to publish or use the
                    image. This contract stipulates what the image is, how it
                    can be used, and whether the licensee can manipulate the
                    image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An agreement is generally discussed prior to the sale of
                    the licensing rights. There are different terms and
                    conditions which may be applicable. Both the licensor and
                    licensee should be in agreement on the scope of the
                    agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The copyright owner will often set the price for the
                    licensing based on the parameters of the agreement. For
                    instance, for an exclusive license where the licensee is
                    the only person allowed to use that work,
                </p>

                <p>
                    the price may be set far higher. In comparison, a
                    non-exclusive license where the copyright holder might
                    license the same work to multiple parties can produce more
                    sales and be priced more moderately.

                    <strong>The Consequences of Not Having One</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A photo usage license agreement protects both the copyright
                    holder and the person licensing the work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are a few consequences that can arise for the
                    copyright holder without a photo licensing agreement:
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Lack of revenue
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Lack of control
                </p>
                <p>
                    Possible consequences for the licensee include the
                    following:
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Inability to use the image
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Inability to keep others from using the image
                </p>

                    <strong>The Most Common Uses</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A photo licensing agreement is generally used when a
                    photographer wants to license his or her work for use
                    without selling the copyright to the image. In this way,
                    the photographer still gets credit for the image and they
                    will get paid for its use.

                    <strong>What Should Be Included?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on the scenario, a photo usage licensing
                    agreement might be very simple or it can contain elaborate
                    terms and restrictions. Here are some of the things that
                    should be included in the agreement:
                </p>
                <p>
                    - The parties
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Exclusive or non-exclusive
                </p>
                <p>
                    - The fee or payment
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Permissions
                </p>
                <p>
                    - License period
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Limitations
                </p>
                <p>
                    A photo licensing agreement allows the copyright holder and
                    licensee to clearly define the ways in which an image can
                    be used. This protects both parties and allows for a
                    mutually beneficial professional relationship.
