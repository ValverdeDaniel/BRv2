          <h2>Get your rights on any platform</h2>
          <p>Rather than search endlessly on stock image websites, or royalty free music libraries, why not search the places that all the best creators are already posting their content and interacting with their followers.</p>
          <p>That's right. We're talking Instagram, Youtube, Soundcloud, Vimeo, Twitter, you name it. As long as you can message the creator, ByteRights can help you.</p>

        <h3>Ask for Permission, not Forgiveness</h3>
        <p>Find any piece of content you like and use our proposal tool to share some details about how you want to use it with the owner.</p>
        <p>All the creator has to do is hit Accept and you'll be on your way towards creating an awesome collaboration together.</p>
        <p>If they're not convinced, you can message and negotiate the terms of your agreement right on the platform.</p>

        <h3>Compensate Your Contributors</h3>
        <p>Art doesn’t create itself.</p>
        <p>Whether it’s an everyday camera-phone photographer or a professional with a DSLR, people are making beautiful content and that’s not easy.</p>
        <p>Agree on crediting each other's work when uploading to various platforms and mentioning each other on social media so as to bolster each other's fanbases.</p>
        <p>Consider compensating your partners with money, gift cards, free stuff, or anything else your imagination can come up with. It’s not only a nice thing to do, but it will also strengthen your reputation.</p>

        <p>Download full contracts for any of your agreements if the need arises.</p>
        <p>Our APIs will allow other platforms to see your ByteRights automatically to make things much easier.</p>
