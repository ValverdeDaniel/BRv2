# BRv2
Me and my buddy spent 8 months building this. The goal of the first product was of making licensing creative work easier to process, store, share and have a legal contract behind. The other goal was to help micro influencers receive compensation for posting about businesses. Covid killed this project but we learned a lot and it was fun to build.

don't forget to npm install all of the dependencies

just trying to get you up and running so currently the keys are public and all you should need to do to get it running is npm install :)
